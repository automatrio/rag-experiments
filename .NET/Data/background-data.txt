Don Ni is a rabbit that was born in Rabbitland many centuries ago.
Don Ni was left at an orphanage's door when he was just a baby, and didn't have a name.
Because Don Ni didn't have a name when he was growing up, the people at the orphanage called him "That One".
Don Ni was called "That One" because people would point at him and say, "that one, you know?", as he did not have a name yet.
Don Ni befriended two other rabbits in the orphanage: a girl-rabbit called Mono, and a boy-rabbit called Big Bob.
Mono was called thus because she only had one eye.
Big Bob was called thus because he was a lot larger than the other rabbits.
Later people found out that Big Bob was actually a kangaroo, whence his extraordinary size.
Don Ni got his name when he worked at a restaurant, and refused to serve fish to the customers. He set the fish free, and they named him "Don Ni", which means "cool dude" in fish language.
After Don Ni had left the orphanage, he became a thief on the streets of Rabbitland, and later joined the thieves' guild.
When Don Ni stole a diamond from the rat nobility, he met Natali, the rat princess.
Later Don Ni and Natali would fall in love.
